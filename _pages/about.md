Hi! My name is Junkai Wu (伍俊愷 in Chinese). I'm a second year Ph.D. student at the [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.uw.edu/) of the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), advised by [Prof. Mari Ostendorf](https://people.ece.uw.edu/ostendorf/). My research interests are in audio, speech, and language processing. 

Before coming to UW, I got my B.S. in Computer Engineering from the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://ece.illinois.edu/), where I worked with [Prof. Paris Smaragdis](https://paris.cs.illinois.edu/) and [Prof. Mark Hasegawa-Johnson](https://speechtechnology.web.illinois.edu/mark-a-hasegawa-johnson/).

Here's my [CV](/assets/pdf/JunkaiWu_Resume_Oct2024.pdf) and my email address is "junkaiwu [@] uw [dot] edu".
